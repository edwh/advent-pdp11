          In the beginning, there was nothing.

          Well, that's not quite true. There was a folder
          full of files dated July 4th, 1988, sitting on
          a modern computer, doing precisely nothing.

          The files had names like ADVENT.B2S and
          ADVMSG.SUB, and to the untrained eye they
          looked like gibberish.

          But it was not gibberish at all. It was a
          multi-user dungeon game from 1986-7, written
          by teenagers at Manchester Grammar School.

          Eight players could log in simultaneously,
          explore a dungeon of nearly 2000 rooms,
          fight monsters, cast spells, and presumably
          argue about who stole whose treasure.

          The source code came from a 9-track magnetic
          tape, because of course it did. Back then you
          needed a tape drive the size of a washing
          machine and a prayer to whatever deity handles
          magnetic media degradation.

          38 years later, an AI was summoned to make
          sense of it all...
